# My Programming
This repository keeps track of all the programs I have created through out the years in different Programming Languages.

It contains
1. a variety of implemented data structures
2. mini programs to test a certain learned skill
3. smaller program(s) that where then put together to create some larger program(s)

It serves as a programming resume.
NOTE: Alot of these programs where built on different computers, I beleive I have the Newest version for each, but that may not always be the case, some may be older version and have errors. I hope you can overlook any small errors as I try to fix them little by little.
