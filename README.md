# My Programming
This repository keeps track of all the programs I have created through out the years in different Programming Languages.

It contains
1. a variety of implemented data structures
2. mini programs to test a certain learned skills
3. smaller program(s) that where then put together to create some larger program(s)

It serves as a programming resume.
